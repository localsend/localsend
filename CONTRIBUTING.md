TODO:

You can help in publishing LocalSend on more platforms. Please create an issue to notify us!

- Traditional Linux distributions (Debian, Fedora, etc.)
- (Your idea here)

## Notes

Useful notes.

### Compile production APK

You will need the signing keys to generate an APK.

Either generate one or use the debug signing options:

```groovy
// File: android/app/build.gradle
buildTypes {
  release {
    signingConfig signingConfigs.debug // using debug signing
  }
}
```

### Bump Flutter

Suppose we want to update flutter to `3.7.8` (see https://github.com/localsend/localsend/commit/7b95a7a5600db2742a9e05b956d0415d871239d5):

1. Update flutter from fvm: `fvm use 3.7.8`
2. Update flutter from submodule:
   1. `git submodule update --init`
   2. `cd submodules/flutter`
   3. `git fetch`
   4. `git checkout 3.7.8`
   5. `cd ../..`
   6. `git add submodules/flutter`
3. Update flutter constraints:
   1. In CI: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
   2. In pubspec: `pubspec.yaml`

### Release

Make sure to set up the self-hosted runner to compile arm64 linux binaries.

To set up the runner, follow the following instructions:

Install Flutter

```bash
sudo apt install git
git clone https://github.com/flutter/flutter.git $HOME/flutter
nano $HOME/.bashrc
```

Add the following to the end of the file:

```bash
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/flutter/bin"
```

Restart the terminal.

```bash
flutter doctor
```

Next, follow the instructions to set up the GitHub runner.

Start the "Release Draft" workflow from the "Actions" tab: https://github.com/localsend/localsend/actions/workflows/release.yml

Finally, compile binaries not yet supported by the pipeline.
